Getting Support
===============

**Please do not open GitHub issues for support questions.** We use issues for
tracking bugs and feature requests.

Better ways to get support are:

* Join the `Matrix channel #rauc:matrix.org
  <https://matrix.to/#/#rauc:matrix.org>`_ (bridged to the IRC channel
  ``#rauc`` on libera.chat).
* Create a new `discussion <https://github.com/rauc/rauc/discussions/categories/q-a>`_.
